# VirtualTourist

VirtualTourist is an iOS application that allows users specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums for each location.

## Installation

To build VirtualTourist you need to create a file called **ApiKeys.plist** in the app folder that needs to contain an entry called **FLICKR_API_KEY** that contains your Flickr API Key.

## Usage

The app will have two view controller scenes.

- Travel Locations Map View: Allows the user to drop pins around the world
- Photo Album View: Allows the users to download and edit an album for a location
